Key results

1. Poisson regression to assess effect of year on gestational age rates.
Figure: GA_lineplot_SUBGROUPS.png
Model: counts ~ Birth_year + lockdowngroup, using log(BirthsTotal) as the offset, lockdowngroup being lockdown (3/16-6/7) vs reopening (6/8-9/21), and birth year ranging from 2012-2019
Results: Late term was the only result that was statistically significant (P=0.0261, RR=0.87). All other P>0.095
Interpretation: There was a significant decrease in late term births since 2012, so these babies were excluded from downstream analyses

2. Chi-squared test to test the null hypothesis of independence between gestational age and covid, performed separately for lockdown (3/16-6/7) and reopening (6/8-9/21) groups
Figures: GA_lockdown.png, GA_reopening.png
Results: chi-sequared P for lockdown=0.875, reopening=0.0067. For reopening, % change compared to median ranged from -84% to -18%
Interepretation: There was a statistically significant decrease in premature births during the reopening but not lockdown period. Unlike prior studies, this decrease in premature births was observed across multiple mutually exclusive categories of prematurity and exhibited a dose-response relationship (more severe prematurity ~ larger decrease). Because this trend was not seen in the lockdown group suggests that year-on-year trends unrelated to the COVID-19 pandemic are less likely to be driving these observations.
3. Chi-squared comparing just 2019 vs 2020 during same period, performed to ensure that the results were not driven by trends occurring during earlier years.
Results: chi-sequared P for reopening=0.24. % change compared to median ranged from -78.0% to -13.0%
Interepretation: although not statistically significant, likely given small sample sizes, the percent changes were comparable to those when compared to multiple prior years, further supporting the notion that this effect was mediated by effects unique to the COVID-19 pandemic
